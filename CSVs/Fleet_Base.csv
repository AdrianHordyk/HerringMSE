nyears,44,,,assume B0 in 1972,"Historical estimates run from 1992/3-2015/6. Fishery data goes back farther, but no F estimates. We can guess and takea more data poor approch for those years."
Spat_targ,1,1,Distribution of fishing in relation to spatial biomass: ,,"We have no spatial information, so we will assume that fishing is even distributed."
Fsd,0.04,0.12,Inter-annual variability in fishing mortality rate,I estimated SD from estimates of F - try for now,I'm not 100% clear on how this works if we have a quota managed fishery and info on historical F.
qinc,0,0,Average percentage change in fishing efficiency,,"For the base model, we will assume this is zero. In futire models, we may want to look at scenarios where efficieny increases but effort decreases."
qcv,0,0,Inter-annual variability in fishing efficiency (uniform distribution)(applicable only to forward projection and input controls),,"For the base model, we will assume this is zero. In futire models, we may want to look at scenarios where efficieny increases but effort decreases."
EffYears,1,2,"Note that I included estimated F, Fupper, and Flower as estimated in the stock assessment model in the Additonal Data File.",sample externally,
EffLower,900,900,,,
EffUpper,999,999,,,
SelYears,,,"Vector of verticies, index for years at which historical selectivity pattern changed.",,"The period between 1992 (when the stock assessment starts) and 1997 were chracterized by 2 gear types. After 1997, only gilnet was allowed. In 2003, there was a decrease in the minimum mesh size."
AbsSelYears,,,"Optional values for SelYears, used for plotting only. Must be of same length as SelYears",sample externally,
L5,999,999,,sample externally,"I think we aren't going to use these because we have selectivities for the roundhaul + gillnet period, and the gillnet period"
